              <p>Any questions or comments or issues you see with the site,  email me at chnkyfire@gmail.com.  I’ll probably read it and may or may not get back to you.</p>

              <li>Make sure you see your picks on the final confirmation page.  That way you know that your picks have been entered into the database.  Also, if you want to see your picks, at any time you can enter your email in the Find Bracket input box and it will bring up your picks.  You can download the picks also but it’s not formatted very well right now.  </li>
